Employee Management REST API
This project demonstrates a REST API for managing employees with best practices in error handling, Swagger UI documentation, and HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) integration.

Technologies
Java (JDK 17)
Spring Boot (3.3.3)
Spring Data JPA (with Hibernate)
Postgresql
Spring HATEOAS
Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation
Spring Boot Starter Web
**Features**
CRUD Operations: Basic create, read, update, and delete functionality for Employee entities.
HATEOAS Integration: Adds HATEOAS links to responses for easy API navigation.
Detailed Error Handling: Returns standardized JSON error responses for easier debugging and error handling on the client side.
Swagger UI Documentation: Automatically generated documentation for exploring API endpoints.
Getting Started
Access Swagger UI: After starting the application, navigate to http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html to explore API documentation.

Error Handling
This project follows best practices in error handling by providing a consistent error response structure for all API requests:

Global Exception Handler: A GlobalExceptionHandler is used to manage exceptions at a global level using @ControllerAdvice.
Standardized Error Response: Custom error responses include:
status: Error type (e.g., "error").
message: Detailed error message.
code: HTTP status code.
Example of a 404 Not Found error response:

json
Copy code
{
    "status": "error",
    "message": "Employee not found",
    "code": 404
}
Swagger UI Documentation
The API is documented with Swagger using Springdoc OpenAPI 3.0, allowing developers to explore available endpoints and try out API requests directly from the browser.

Key Points:
Annotations: Each controller method is annotated with @Operation and @ApiResponses to provide descriptions, response codes, and parameter details.
Interactive API: Swagger UI provides a user-friendly interface to interact with the API without needing additional tools.
To view the API documentation, open http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html after running the application.

HATEOAS Integration
HATEOAS adds relevant links to each resource, making the API more self-discoverable and user-friendly for clients.

Self Links: Each employee includes a link to retrieve its own details (self link).
Collection Links: Every Employee response includes a link to list all employees.
Update and Delete Links: Links to update or delete the specific employee are provided for easy navigation.
Example HATEOAS Response for an Employee:
json
Copy code
{
    "id": 1,
    "firstName": "Ola",
    "lastName": "Wale",
    "email": "ola.wale@example.com",
    "username": "olawale",
    "address": "154 Effurun, Warri",
    "gender": "Male",
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1"
        },
        "all-employees": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/employees"
        },
        "update-employee": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1"
        },
        "delete-employee": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/api/employees/1"
        }
    }
}
Project Structure
Controller: Contains the main REST API endpoints.
Service: Business logic for handling employee data.
Repository: Handles data persistence using Spring Data JPA.
Exception: Centralized exception handling and custom exception classes.
DTO: Data Transfer Object for Employee data representation.
Model: Entity model mapped to the database.

By following these best practices, this project aims to provide a robust and user-friendly REST API for employee management.
