This project is a simple Spring Boot-based REST API for managing employee data. It demonstrates how to use Dependency Injection (DI) in Spring using different methods such as constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection.

Features
Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on employee entities.
Implements best practices in Spring for dependency injection.
Example usage of @RestController, @Service, and @Repository annotations.
DTO pattern for data transfer.
Dependency Injection Overview
In Spring, Dependency Injection (DI) allows objects to be injected with their dependencies rather than creating them internally. This improves flexibility, testability, and scalability. In this project, we demonstrate three ways of practicing DI:

Constructor Injection: Preferred for required dependencies.
Setter Injection: Useful for optional or changeable dependencies.
Field Injection: A simpler method but less preferred due to testability and immutability concerns.

**Constructor Injection**
Constructor-based dependency injection is widely considered the best practice in Spring. It ensures that all necessary dependencies are provided when an object is instantiated and helps maintain immutability.

Example: EmployeeController.java

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/employees")
public class EmployeeController {

   ** private final EmployeeService employeeService;**

    // Constructor Injection
   @Autowired
    public EmployeeController(EmployeeService employeeService) {
        this.employeeService = employeeService;
    }

}

Why Constructor Injection?

Immutability: Dependencies are set once and can't be changed.
Testability: Allows easier injection of mock dependencies in unit tests.
Clarity: Required dependencies are explicitly listed in the constructor.
Setter Injection
Setter-based dependency injection allows injecting dependencies via public setter methods. It's useful for optional dependencies that might need to change after object construction.

Example: EmployeeController.java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/employees")
public class EmployeeController {

   private EmployeeService employeeService;

    // Setter Injection
   @Autowired
    public void setEmployeeService(EmployeeService employeeService) {
        this.employeeService = employeeService;
    }

    
}
When to Use Setter Injection?

Optional Dependencies: When dependencies are not always required or can be updated after object creation.
Flexibility: Allows dependencies to be modified post-construction.
Field Injection
Field-based injection directly injects the dependency into the class field using the @Autowired annotation. This is a quick way to inject dependencies but is generally less favored compared to constructor injection.

Example: EmployeeController.java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/employees")
public class EmployeeController {

    // Field Injection
@Autowired
private EmployeeService employeeService;
    
}
Limitations of Field Injection:

Testability: More difficult to test because it requires reflection to inject mock dependencies.
Immutability: Fields are not final, making them mutable after object creation.
Implicit Dependencies: Dependencies are not explicitly listed in the constructor, reducing clarity.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
JDK 11 or later
Maven 3.6+
IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)
Postman or cURL (for testing the API)
Running the Application
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-api.git
Navigate to the project directory:

Copy code
cd employee-management-api
Build and run the application:
bash
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run

Conclusion
This project demonstrates different ways to implement Dependency Injection in Spring Boot using constructors, setters, and fields. Each method has its advantages and use cases, but constructor injection is generally the preferred method for required dependencies due to its benefits in immutability and testability.
